# Inconsistencies in Smart Contract Implementation: A Case Study of the KyberSwap Exploit

## Abstract

This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the KyberSwap exploit, a complex attack that exposed inconsistencies in the smart contract's state management. The analysis reveals that the root cause of the exploit lies not only in the incorrect use of a rounding operation but also in inconsistencies between the states of key functions that manage liquidity and price adjustments. These inconsistencies occur when certain functions fail to synchronize their updates to the contract's state, leading to exploitable vulnerabilities. To address this issue, a novel approach is proposed, which involves defining and monitoring equivalences between states in the contract. This approach ensures that the contract behaves deterministically and consistently, preventing state inconsistency errors.

## Introduction

The KyberSwap exploit, which occurred on November 22, 2023[^1], was a sophisticated attack that leveraged the incorrect use of a rounding operation in the `estimateIncrementalLiquidity`[^2][^3] function of the KyberSwap smart contract. However, this paper argues that the critical bug appeared not just because of rounding in the wrong direction but because of state inconsistency in `estimateIncrementalLiquidity` and `computeSwapStep` functions, where the former acts as if it hasn't crossed the tick boundary, while the latter acts as if it has.

The exploit involved a series of actions that leveraged both arithmetic and state management inconsistencies, including:

1. Manipulating the price of a pair to swap with a liquidity provided by the attacker, thereby becoming the sole provider of liquidity.
2. Performing an actual swap in one direction with flawed terms, which triggers one part of the contract to move to another tick, while keeping the other part of the contract within the previous tick due to the confident use of both swap and liquidity amounts.
3. Performing a swap back within the same pair with a larger amount of tokens at a flawed price, effectively draining the liquidity pool of the previous tick.

## Mathematical Formulation

Let $f_1, f_2, \ldots, f_n$ be a set of functions that manipulate contract states, and let $x$ be the input data (e.g., liquidity amounts, token balances, or price estimates). We define a function $S$ that takes in the results of applying these functions to $x$ and determines the resulting contract states (e.g., liquidity pool status, tick positions, and token balances):

$$S(f_1(x), f_2(x), \ldots, f_n(x)) = (s_1, s_2, \ldots, s_n)$$

where $s_1, s_2, \ldots, s_n$ are the states determined by the results of $f_1(x), f_2(x), \ldots, f_n(x)$. The function $S$ is constructed by aggregating the results of the individual functions $f_i$ and determining the resulting contract state based on the aggregated values.

The consistency condition requires that the contract's state is consistent across different functions, i.e., for any two sets of functions $f_1, f_2, \ldots, f_n$ and $g_1, g_2, \ldots, g_n$, the states derived from applying these functions to the input $x$ should be equivalent:

$$ S(f_1(x), f_2(x), \ldots, f_n(x)) = S(g_1(x), g_2(x), \ldots, g_n(x)) $$

for all $f_1, f_2, \ldots, f_n$ and $g_1, g_2, \ldots, g_n$ in the set of functions. This condition ensures that the contract's state is consistent and deterministic, regardless of the specific functions used to update the state.

## Algorithm

The proposed algorithm involves the following steps:

1. Define multiple functions $f_1, f_2, \ldots, f_n$ that represent different contract operations (such as liquidity adjustments, price estimations, or state updates) which may affect various aspects of the contract's state. These functions are defined based on the specific requirements of the contract and the desired behavior of the system.
2. Apply these functions to the input $x$ to get the results $f_1(x), f_2(x), \ldots, f_n(x)$. The results are then aggregated using the function $S$ to determine the resulting contract state.
3. Use the results to determine the states $s_1, s_2, \ldots, s_n$ using the function $S$. The states are then checked for consistency using the consistency condition.
4. Check if the states are consistent by verifying the consistency condition. If the states are inconsistent, the algorithm identifies the specific functions that caused the inconsistency and updates the contract state accordingly.

## Pseudocode Implementation

To illustrate the proposed algorithm, we provide a pseudocode implementation in Python:
```python
def estimate_incremental_liquidity(x):
  # implement the estimateIncrementalLiquidity function
  return x * 2

def compute_swap_step(x):
  # implement the computeSwapStep function
  return x / 3

def determine_state(var1, var2):
  # implement the determine_state function
  s1 = "Insufficient Liquidity" if var1 <= 100 else "Sufficient Liquidity"
  s2 = "Sufficient Liquidity" if var2 >= 50 else "Insufficient Liquidity"
  return s1, s2

def check_consistency(f1, f2, x):
  var_in_one_part = f1(x)
  var_in_another_part = f2(x)
  state1, state2 = determine_state(var_in_one_part, var_in_another_part)
  return state1 == state2

# test the function
x = 123
result = check_consistency(estimate_incremental_liquidity, compute_swap_step, x)
print("States are consistent" if result else "States are not consistent")
```

## Algo Rationale

The proposed algorithm is based on the idea of detecting and preventing inconsistencies in the smart contract implementation by monitoring the equivalences between related states. The algorithm uses a combination of function aggregation and consistency checking to ensure that the contract's state is consistent and deterministic.

## Core Algo Advantages

The proposed algorithm provides several advantages, including:

1. **Prevention of inconsistencies**: The algorithm prevents inconsistencies in the smart contract implementation, ensuring that the contract behaves deterministically and consistently.
2. **Generality**: The algorithm is purposed to detect various states inconsistency errors, making it applicable to a wide range of smart contract implementations.
3. **Flexibility**: The algorithm can be used with different types of smart contracts, including those with complex state management and multiple functions.

## Core Algo Limitation

The proposed algorithm has several limitations, including:

1. **Manual setup**: The algorithm requires manual setup for defining which functions represent critical state updates in the contract (e.g., liquidity adjustments, price estimations).
2. **Infrastructure requirements**: The algorithm requires significant infrastructure, including a robust and scalable platform for executing the contract and monitoring the state.

## Algo Evaluation

The proposed algorithm can be evaluated using metrics such as:

1. **Error detection rate**: The algorithm's ability to detect inconsistencies, which is defined as the ratio of correctly detected inconsistencies to the total number of inconsistencies.
2. **False positive rate**: The algorithm's ability to avoid false positives, which is defined as the ratio of incorrectly detected inconsistencies to the total number of inconsistencies.
3. **Computational efficiency**: The algorithm's computational efficiency, which is defined as the time and resources required to execute the algorithm.

The desired values for these metrics are:

* Error detection rate: 100%
* False positive rate: 0%
* Computational efficiency: O(n), where n is the number of functions and states

By using these metrics, we can evaluate the performance of the algorithm and identify areas for improvement.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, the analysis of the KyberSwap exploit highlights how state consistency between critical contract functions is essential to prevent attacks. The proposed algorithm offers a novel approach to detecting and preventing such inconsistencies by monitoring the synchronization of contract states, which could help prevent similar exploits in the future. The proposed approach provides a novel solution to detect and prevent state inconsistencies, and it can be applied to prevent similar exploits in the future.
